# Pacman
Game "Pacman" on Java.
Game was created using libraries: Java swing, awt. The game has random generation of the map, based on size of the gameboard. Ghosts move and spawn boosts randomly. Windows are resize-able. 
After end of the game user write his/her nickname and after this user can find his result in the high scores table. By the way, I use serializable interface to encrypt data and then put it 
into file for high scores table.
